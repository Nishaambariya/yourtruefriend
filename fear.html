		<p style="margin-top:50px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:100px; color:#d54062; font-size:25px; text-align:center; font-family:'Work Sans',cursive;">The coronavirus, or COVID-19, is inciting panic for a number of reasons. It’s a new virus, meaning no one has immunity, and there is no vaccine. Its novelty means that scientists aren’t sure yet how it behaves — they have little history to go on. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the virus as a pandemic. In the stock market and communities alike, herd mentality is taking over: people are being influenced by one another and letting emotions dictate their behavior, instead of taking a rational approach. </p>

		<p style="color:brown">2. The fear and anxiety is intense and persistent (lasting weeks to months)</p>
		<p style="color:brown">3. You’re actively avoiding situations (for instance, places, people, activities) even when they’re safe</p>
		<p style="color:brown">4. You’re spending a lot of your time monitoring your body for signs and symptoms, or searching the internet about the virus</p>
		<p style="color:brown">5. You’ve become overly obsessive about cleaning, washing, and decontaminating.</p>

			<h1 style="color:white;">1.) Reframe “I am stuck inside” to “I can finally focus on my home and myself”</h1>
			<br>
			<p>As dismal as the world may feel right now, think of the mandated work-from-home policy as an opportunity to refocus your attention from the external to the internal. Doing one productive thing per day can lead to a more positive attitude. Set your sights on long-avoided tasks, reorganize, or create something you’ve always wanted to. Approaching this time with a mindset of feeling trapped or stuck will only stress you out more. This is your chance to slow down and focus on yourself.</p>
			<br>
			<h1 style="color:white;">2.) Stay close to your normal routine</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Try and maintain some semblance of structure from the pre-quarantine days. For those individuals with children, sticking to a routine might be easier; however as you work from home, it could be tempting to fall into a more lethargic lifestyle, which could lead to negative thinking. Wake up and go to bed around the same time, eat meals, shower, adapt your exercise regimen, and get out of your PJ’s. Do laundry on Sundays as usual. Not only will sticking to your normal routine keep you active and less likely to spiral, it will be easier to readjust to the outside world when it’s time to get back to work.</p>
			<br>
			<h1 style="color:white;">3.) Avoid obsessing over endless Coronavirus coverage</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Freeing up your day from work or social obligations gives you plenty of time to obsess, and if you have a tendency to consult Google for every itch and sneeze, you may be over-researching the pandemic as well. Choosing only certain credible websites (who.int or cdc.gov is a good start) for a limited amount of time each day (perhaps two chunks of 30 minutes each) will be in your best interest during this time.</p>
			<br>
			<h1 style="color:white;">4.) A chaotic home can lead to a chaotic mind</h1>
			<br>
			<p>With all the uncertainly happening outside your home, keep the inside organized, predictable and clean. Setting up mental zones for daily activities can be helpful to organize your day. For example, try not to eat in bed or work on the sofa- just as before, eat at the kitchen table and work at your desk. Loosening these boundaries just muddles your routine and can make the day feel very long. Additionally, a cluttered home can cause you to become uneasy and claustrophobic of your environment- so keep it tidy.</p>
			<br>
			<h1 style="color:white;">5.) Start a new quarantine ritual</h1>
			<br>
			<p>With this newfound time, why not do something special during these quarantined days? For ex-ample, perhaps you can start a daily journal to jot down thoughts and feelings to reflect on later. Or take a walk every day at 4 pm, connect with your sister over FaceTime every morning, or start a watercolor painting which you can add to everyday. Having something special during this time will help you look forward to each new day.</p>
			<br>
			<h1 style="color:white;">6.) Use telehealth as an option to talk to a professional if your anxiety becomes unmanageable</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Many licensed psychologists are offering telehealth options over HIPAA-compliant video chat platforms. Remember to reach out for help if your anxiety is reaching proportions that is unmanageable without professional help.<br><br>Letting go of illusions of control and finding peace in the fact that you are doing your part to “flatten the curve” will certainly build mental strength to combat the stressful situation the whole globe is experiencing.
